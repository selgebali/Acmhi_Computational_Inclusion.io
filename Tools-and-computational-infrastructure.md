The choice of tools and infrastructure can be influenced by several factors, such as;
data portability (transitioning the data from one environment to another), security and privacy, popularity and use, etc.

We list the most popular tools in each category as a guide for the desired core functionality and technical specifications for the users' needs. 
 Before making a choice for one tool or the other, take into account the aforementioned differences between them (ie data portability or privacy respect, source code availability, etc).
Also, while there is some overlap in the categories and the applications listed, some provide extended functionality and support over more specific ones (for example Zenodo o CKAN are more oriented towards data sharing than file sharing).
