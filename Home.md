Welcome to the computational-inclusion wiki!

Group: Sara and Offray

This project extends and complements ideas of Dos and Donâ€™ts in computational training, started in this GitHub Repo, with practices, knowledge and tools collected in the eLife Sprint 2019 in Cambridge UK (Sept, 4-5).

This is part of an ongoing effort that aims to showcase and map the diversity of helpful approaches in computational training practices on a global scale.

You might find similarities with resources such as the Awesome list, which is a diverse and eclectic list, providing introductory points to several other technologies, learning materials, communities and practices that are related to computational training, and it also provides a broad overview of what is being done in that front.

This resource provides advice and solutions for computational training events.
