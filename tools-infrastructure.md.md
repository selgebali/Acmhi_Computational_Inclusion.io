## Tools and infrastructure 

The choice of tools and infrastructure can be influecenced by several factors, such as;
data portability (transitioning the data from one environment to another), security and privacy, popularity and use, etc.

We mention the most popular tool as an exemplar of each category, to guide
you in the core functionality and intented user experience, but take into
account the aforementioned diferences between them (ie data portability or 
privacy respect, source code availability, etc).
Also, while there is some overlap in the categories and the exemplary
apps, some provide extended functionality and support over more specific
ones (for example Zenodo o CKAN are more oriented towards data sharing than
file sharing).
