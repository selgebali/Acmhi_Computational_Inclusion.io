## Teaching and learning materials, books, booklets, syllabus

People approach to computational training from different backgrounds.
Likewise, they have different expectations on how computational training
will talk with their previous experience, knowledge and life paths.
Here we try to showcase the books, booklets, syllabus that account for
such diversity.
Some of them will have a "classical" approach to computational training,
going to the techniques used behind, while others will do alternative
approaches, showcasing critical approaches to computation or 
crafmans/personal takes on data.
