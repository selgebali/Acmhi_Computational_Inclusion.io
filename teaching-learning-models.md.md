## Teaching/learning models

  - Knowing your audience
 - The martial arts dojo methodology for workshops (first beginners interacting with each other, then advanced players with each other, finally all expertise levels interact with each other, cross experiences)
 - Classical classroom
 - Problem based
- If you are running regular sessions with a group of students , how do you start a dialogue or initiate a support group that extends beyond the training?
