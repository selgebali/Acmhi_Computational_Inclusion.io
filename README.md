# Welcome to the computational-inclusion wiki!


Many areas in academia have recently become increasingly data driven, producing an inexorable amount of data, which in turn has shifted the way we conduct research.

Big data produced in all stages of a research life cycle necessitate different tools, platforms, workflows, applications, resources and computing skills spurring scientific advancement and innovation, along with a shift in societal and research norms towards openness.

Adopting core democratic open science values; such as access to knowledge and data sharing have centre-staged the big data debate. However, when we discuss open science practices, it is important to consider who is in the configuration/capacity of working openly and who is not. 

The debate is geared towards addressing the needs and concerns of the "digitally rich” i.e those who generate big data and/or have the computational resources for data handling.  

To alleviate the digital divide, it is paramount to ensure equity and inclusion of diverse and under-represented communities in the open science debate by improving computational inclusion. To that end, we need to understand the challenges affecting provision of knowledge and participation in open science. 

This project intitally started as a list of Do's and Don’ts in computational training, see  [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/selgebali/CCMcr19_dos). The aim was to build a resource to provide a compilation of advice, good practices, and tools collected from trainers and students in computational training events around the globe, since training is a key element in plugging in the gap of required computational skills ensuring the integration of individuals from a varied background. 


The first edition of the list of Do's and Dont's was created with the input of Carpentry trainers during the [Carpentry Connect Manchester 2019](https://software.ac.uk/ccmcr19). 


The second edition is a joint effort by Sara and Offray during the [eLife Sprint 2019 in Cambridge UK (Sept, 4-5)](https://sprint.elifesciences.org/).


As a part of an ongoing effort this resource provides actionable advice, a list of tools and helpful approaches in computational training practices on a global scale. 


### Part of this project includes a survey where we aim to assess the academic landscape with regards to;

- Which tools are used by researchers at different data life-cycle i.e. Planning, Creation/collection of data, Analysis, Sharing, Preservation.

- Which tools are used by researchers in aid of improving computational inclusion such as those used in capacity building/training and community building.

- What technological challenges/ shortcomings contribute to reduced computational inclusion.

Furthermore, we will be looking at trends in computational infrastructure and resources in different geographical regions to identify areas with reduced computational inclusion such as low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).  

By gaining insight of the academic computational landscape in different environments, we will have a better understanding of the needs and requirements of individuals from different backgrounds. 

This will aid in bringing together diverse communities with varied computational resources into adopting open science practices while empowering them through community building, inclusive training practices and adapted computational solutions.

If you are interested in surveying the digital landscape in your institute and/or would like to know more about existing tools and resources that enhance computational inclusion in academic research, please feel free to join the discussion

## Tools and computational infrastructure <a name="Tools"></a>

----
The choice of tools and infrastructure can be influenced by several factors, such as;
data portability (transitioning the data from one environment to another), security and privacy, popularity and use, etc.

We list the most popular tools in each category as a guide for the desired core functionality and technical specifications for the users' needs. 
 Before making a choice for one tool or the other, take into account the aforementioned differences between them (ie data portability or privacy respect, source code availability, etc).
Also, while there is some overlap in the categories and the applications listed, some provide extended functionality and support over more specific ones (for example Zenodo o CKAN are more oriented towards data sharing than file sharing).

####  Please also share any tools you might have used and/or found interesting, especially open-source tools.
