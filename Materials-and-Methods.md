There are different modus operandi in teaching that can be adapted to the type of event and audience needs and resources. Tailoring the teaching session to the audience is crucial in ensuring the success of the event. 
Examples of training methods: 

- Martial arts dojo; a form of peer learning where new learners interact and work together to accomplish some tasks, before moving on to work together with more experienced learners/trainers/training assistants/etc... This allows for an exchange of experiences across all levels.
